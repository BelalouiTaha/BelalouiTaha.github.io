# My process
 ### Built with
 - Semantic HTML5 markup
 - CSS custom properties
 - Flexbox
 - - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
 - - [https://styled-components.com/](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) - For styles
 - - [anime.js] - JS library - For animation

# what i learned
 this was the first time using a map library, learned how to integrate and manipulate maps, add markers using the [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/index.html)

# contined development
for the moment, the api used in this project does not provide location coordinates for the ip address or domain searched for, this leaves me without data to input to my map component, so i had to statically configure the map to point to my school, still didn't make the map responsive to small screen , so it will be covered by the result elemeny
   ### useful resources

- [uiverse](https://uiverse.io/) - for animated elements
